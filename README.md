# fizzbuzz

Fizz Buzz in Rust, just to get comfortable with the language. There are 3 different functions that perform Fizz Buzz in their own way. The first prints the number right away if conditions for both Fizz and Buzz are not met, otherwise evaluates whether the current number is divisible by 3 or 5 and concatenates the two results for printing. The second is a simple if/else check, and the third uses Rust's `match` syntax.
